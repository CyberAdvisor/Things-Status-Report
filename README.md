# Things Status Reporter
A status report generator for Things 3

While Things3 from Cultured Code is a great task manager and planner, it is lacking an easy way to show actual completion of tasks, especially when it is being used in a work context where status reports are required.

I developed this script specifically to address this need for my own use. Please feel free to use and adjust to your specific requirements. By default the status reporting period is a week, but you can adjust as needed when running the report. Also, this will report on all completed tasks for projects in a specified area. If you want to have reports for multiple areas you will need to run the report repeatedly. You can also set the defaults for area and period in the script so you don't have to reenter them everytime. 

The report output is formatted with Markdown so use your favorite markdown compatible editor (Ulysses, Byword, etc) to display the formatted output, which depending on your editor, can then be exported to Word, PDF or HTML. 

In addition to weekly status reporting, this also can be used to generate long term archival reports prior to deleting old completed tasks, as well as to generate planning reports for future activities (planned enhancement). 

To use this script, just copy the source code into Apple's Script Editor and adjust the defaults to your preferences if desired. From there you can save it as an AppleScript Application so that it can be put onto the OSX Dock or executied by double clicking when needed. 

Please report issues using the Github issue tab for this project so that I can track and respond to them centrally. Also, if you would like to be notified of new releases or updates, use Github Watch button a the top of this page. 

Enjoy!
