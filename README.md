# Things Status Reporter
A status report generator for Things 3

While Things3 is a great task manager and planner, it is lacking in an easy way to show actual completion of tasks, especially when it is being used in a work context where status reports are required.

I developed this script specifically to address this need for my own use. Please feel free to use and adjust to your specific requirements. 

To use this script, just copy the source code into Apple's Script Editor and adjust the defaults to your preferences if desired. From there you can save it as an AppleScript Application so that it can be put onto the OSX Dock or executied by double clicking when needed. 

Please report issues using the Github issue
